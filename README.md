# Distributed Algorithms for Boolean Equations over Networks

## Requirements

The codes are implemented in Matlab/Octave, and no special toolboxes are needed.

## Instructions

There are three examples in the paper.

### Example 1: A three-node example for illustrating Algorithm 2

Run example1.m

### Example 2: Distributed computation of equilibria of gene regulartory network with eleven nodes

(1) Conceptual Implementation: 

Run example2_conceptual.m

Note: In Step 3 of Algorithm 2, the projection is directed computed as outcomes of a distributed algorithm.

(2) End-to-End Implementation: 

Run example2.m

Note: in Step 3 of Algorithm 2, the projection is generated by the distributed algorithm.

### Example 3: A three-node example for illustrating Algorithm 5
1. Run example3.m to obtain example3_data.txt
2. According to example3_data.txt, run example3_plot.m to plot Figure 3 in the paper
